while (varible != 0 )
{
  do the Switch > case

  as long as the user dont input 0 the while should loop us inside the switch case code.
   use the varible = 0 as an exit door  
     
}


int main_option = 1;
while (main_option != 0)
{
 wrtie the code for the Main_Menu here

    varible console.read/console.write
    switch(main_options)
        case 1: sub_menu 1
            int option1 = 1;
            while(option1 != 0)
            {
                code for the sub_menu 1
                the while menu here as long as the user dont input 0, it should
                loop us inside case one code.
                while using 0 to break this sub while-loop and go back the parent while loop

    
            }

}

can i do this neater ??????????

the while loop nesting seems a bit messy!!!!!!!


    int option1
    int option2
    int optionx
